# Linear & Logistic Regression
## Linear Regresion Hands on Practice
### Task Description
* Use a stepwise approach to select the best model.
* Leave a part of the data for out-of-sample validation.
* Use at least one factor variable in the model(it might be excluded in the final model version)
* Use performance metrics to assess the model.
* Be sure that model do not have multi-collinear variables
* Remove outliers if any in the data.  

data for the model - hands_on_practice_data-Melbourne_housing_data.csv  
linear-regression.py - contains the best model after many feature tweaks and comparisons.  

## Logistic Regression Graded Task
### Task Description
Your task is to create a logistic regression model and to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The data is given in the file graded_task_data-heart_disease.csv. The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
