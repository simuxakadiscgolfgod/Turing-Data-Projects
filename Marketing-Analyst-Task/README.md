# Marketing Analyst Task
## Task Requirements
You have a follow up task from your marketing manager to identify overall trends of all marketing campaigns on your ecommerce site. She is particularly interested in finding out if users tend to spend more time on your website on certain weekdays and how that behavior differs across campaigns.
* Create a presentation centered around the dynamic weekday duration, focusing on differences between marketing campaigns.
* See whether you can apply 1-2 techniques learned in this or other modules throughout the course material to enhance your presentation on this subject.
* Explore the data. See whether there are interesting data points that can give more insights to your presentation.
* Provide analytical insights, what are the drawbacks of this analysis, what further analysis could you recommend?
