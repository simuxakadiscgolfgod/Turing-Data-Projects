# Product Analyst Task
## Task Requirements
You have a follow up task from your product manager to identify how much time it takes for a user to make a purchase on your website. Your PM would like to see the users' duration from first arriving on the website on any given day until their first purchase on that same day. Your final result should show the duration dynamic daily.

* Create a presentation centered around the dynamic daily duration.
* See whether you can apply 1-2 techniques learned in this module course material to enhance your presentation on this subject.
* Explore the data. See whether there are interesting data points that can give more insights to your presentation.
* Provide analytical insights, what are the drawbacks of this analysis, what further analysis could you recommend?
* You should use the turing_data_analytics.raw_events table to answer this question. Please write a SQL that would extract data from the BigQuery, create effective visualizations, by using a tool that you are familiar with such as Google Spreadsheets, Tableau, Looker Studio, or any other suitable data visualization tool, and briefly comment your findings.

## Results
